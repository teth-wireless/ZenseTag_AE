This artifact evaluation process is intended to ensure that the results
and evaluations outlined in our work are both verifiable and repro-
ducible. We have also provided Keysight Advanced Design System
(ADS) RF simulation files that were used to simulate and verify the
operation principle of ZenseTag. This should help understand how
differential analog measurement of COTS sensors works. Additionally
we have also shared the data and code that were used to obtain the
results shown in our evaluation.
